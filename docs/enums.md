# Enums

Enums (or enumerations) are a type which maps labels to integer literals. Enum variables get converted directly to integers at compile time.

## Syntax

If no value is specified, enums will count up sequentially, starting at 0.

```
enum <Name>
{
    <Label1>,
    <Label2> = <Value>,
    ...
}
```

## Examples

```
enum Mouse
{

}
```

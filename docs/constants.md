# Constants
> **Note:** Not to be confused with [literals](literals.md).

## Variables
Constant variables are meant to only be initialized with a value, and can't be modified at all.
### Syntax
```

```


## Functions
Constant functions are methods that get evaluated at compile time. These can have special syntax (e.g. the `struct` keyword as a type to access fields by name).
